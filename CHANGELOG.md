  - For an overview of all breaking changes in the dbt_qualtrics_source data model, please refer to the [respective release notes](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_qualtrics_source/releases/tag/v0.2.0).

# v0.1.1 dbt_qualtrics

[PR #6](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_qualtrics/pull/6) applies the following changes:

## Bug Fix
- Ensures the date spine in the `qualtrics__daily_breakdown` model always has a non-null start date, especially if you do not have the `distribution_contact` source table whose `min(created_at)` is used to generate the date spine. 
  - If no `distribution_contact` table is present in your Qualtrics connector(s), the minimum date will be set to `2016-01-01`.

## Under the Hood
- Updated the pull request [templates](/.github).
- Included auto-releaser GitHub Actions workflow to automate future releases.

# v0.1.0 dbt_qualtrics 
This is the initial release of the Qualtrics dbt package!

# ðŸ“£ What does this dbt package do?

This package models Qualtrics data from [Fivetran's connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/qualtrics). It uses data in the format described by [this ERD](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/qualtrics#schemainformation) and builds off the output of our [Qualtrics source package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_qualtrics_source).

The main focus of the package is to transform the core object tables into analytics-ready models, including:
- A Response breakdown model which consolidates all survey responses joined with users, questions, and survey details.
- Overview models for Surveys, Contacts, Directories, and Distributions which help to understand the nuances of each and how they affect key survey aggregations.
- A daily breakdown model which provides a high level view of a variety of Qualtrics account metrics at a daily level.
