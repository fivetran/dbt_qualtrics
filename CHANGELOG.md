# dbt_qualtrics v0.1.0
This is the initial release of the Qualtrics dbt package!

# 📣 What does this dbt package do?

This package models Qualtrics data from [Fivetran's connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/qualtrics). It uses data in the format described by [this ERD](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/qualtrics#schemainformation) and builds off the output of our [Qualtrics source package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_qualtrics_source).

The main focus of the package is to transform the core object tables into analytics-ready models, including:
- A Response breakdown model which consolidates all survey responses joined with users, questions, and survey details.
- Overview models for Surveys, Contacts, Directories, and Distributions which help to understand the nuances of each and how they affect key survey aggregations.
- A daily breakdown model which provides a high level view of a variety of Qualtrics account metrics at a daily level.
